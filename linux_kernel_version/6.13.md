# The beginning of the 6.13 merge window

By **Jonathan Corbet**  
November 21, 2024

As of this writing, just over 1,800 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline kernel for the 6.13 release. That number may seem small, given that a typical merge window brings in at least 12,000 commits, but the early pulls this time around have focused on significant core changes, and there are quite a few of them. The time has come to summarize the changes pulled so far, including lazy preemption, multi-grained timestamps, new extended-attribute system calls, and more.

Some of the most significant changes pulled in the first part of the 6.13 merge window include:

#### Architecture-specific

- The arm64 architecture can now run Linux in virtual machines under the [Arm Confidential Compute Architecture](https://www.arm.com/architecture/security-features/arm-confidential-compute-architecture).
- Arm64 also now supports user-space shadow stacks with the [Guarded Control Stack](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/arch/arm64/gcs.html) feature.
- The s390 architecture has gained support for the resizing of virtual machines with [virtio-mem](https://virtio-mem.gitlab.io/). There is an overview in [this commit message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/38968bcdcc1d).
- [Split-lock detection](https://lwn.net/Articles/911219/) is now supported on AMD CPUs.
- There is now [support](https://git.kernel.org/linus/322a90638768) for MIPS multi-cluster interrupt controllers.

#### Core kernel

- The [PIDFD_GET_INFO ioctl() operation](https://lwn.net/Articles/992991/), which will fetch information about a process represented by a pidfd, has been merged.
- The io_uring subsystem has a new command, IORING_REGISTER_RESIZE_RINGS, that allows on-the-fly resizing of the submission and completion rings. This allows applications to start with a pair of relatively small rings, and grow them later should the need arise.
- The [lazy preemption](https://lwn.net/Articles/994322/) patches have been merged. This work greatly simplifies the kernel's preemption logic (and configuration options) while maintaining performance for throughput-oriented configurations. It is a significant change that should, eventually, reduce the amount of scheduling-related logic scattered through the non-scheduler parts of the kernel.
- Some preliminary work needed to implement [proxy execution](https://lwn.net/Articles/953438/), an improved approach to the avoidance of priority inversion, has been merged. The proxy execution feature itself, though, has not yet landed.

#### Filesystems and block I/O

- There have been a few tries to implement fine-grained timestamps for file metadata; the last one [ran aground](https://lwn.net/Articles/946394/) at the end of 2023. Another attempt is being made for 6.13; [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/6ac81fd55e8a) contains the details of how it works.
  
  In short: as before, filesystems only need to track fine-grained change times for a given file if the time is being actively queried; most of the time, low-resolution timestamps are good enough. That is important, since lower-resolution timestamps do not need to be written back to persistent storage as frequently. The previous implementation ran into problems, though, where a low-resolution timestamp could appear to be earlier than a high-resolution timestamp, even though the actual changes happened in the opposite order.
  
  In the new implementation, the kernel remembers the last fine-grained timestamp that was given out and ensures that any coarse-grained timestamps assigned for file modifications are later than the that last fine-grained value. This technique avoids the above-mentioned problem, ensuring that timestamps always correctly reflect the order in which files were modified.
  
  See [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/e3fad0376d80) for more information.
  
- There is a new sysctl knob, fs.dentry-negative, that controls whether the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer deletes a file's kernel-internal directory entry ("dentry") when the file itself is deleted. It seems that some benchmarks do better when dentries are removed, while others benefit from having a negative dentry left behind, so the kernel developers have put the decision into the system administrator's hands. The default value (zero) means that dentries are not automatically deleted, matching the behavior of previous kernels.
  
- The [statmount()](https://lwn.net/Articles/950569/) system call has gained options to return the filesystem subtype, superblock source, and security mount options. There is also a new flag, STATMOUNT_OPT_ARRAY, that returns filesystem options as a series of NUL-separated strings and without the usual "\000" escaping.
  
- There have been some deep reference-counting changes within the VFS layer that yield a 3-5% performance improvement on highly threaded workloads; see [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/62eec753cae2) for some details.
  
- It is now possible to assemble an [overlayfs](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html) stack using file descriptors rather than path names; see [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a29835c9d0ba) for details.
  
- The tmpfs filesystem can now be mounted in a case-folding mode where file names are no longer case-sensitive. See [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a713f830c903) for the relevant mount options.
  
- Limited support for [atomic write operations](https://lwn.net/Articles/974578/) has been added to the ext4 and XFS filesystems.
  
- There is a new set of system calls for the management of extended attributes: setxattrat(), getxattrat(), listxattrat(), and removexattrat(). They are variants of [setxattr()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setxattr.2.html), [getxattr()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getxattr.2.html), [listxattr()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listxattr.2.html), and [removexattr()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/removexattr.2.html) that include a directory file descriptor as the starting point for the path-name search.
  
- The new BTRFS_IOC_SUBVOL_SYNC_WAIT ioctl() command for the Btrfs filesystem will wait for the cleaning of one or more subvolumes. It is an unprivileged operation, and is intended to allow the "btrfs subvolume sync" command to work without privilege.
  
- Btrfs now supports performing encoded reads (reading of compressed extents directly, without decompression) via io_uring.
  

#### Hardware support

- **Hardware monitoring**: Renesas ISL28022 power monitors and Nuvoton NCT7363Y fan controllers.
- **Miscellaneous**: Marvell PEM performance-monitoring units, Airoha true HW random number generators, Broadcom BCM74110 random number generators, Renesas RZ/V2H(P) interrupt control units, and THEAD C9XX ACLINT S-mode IPI interrupt controllers.

#### Miscellaneous

- There is a new user-space API allowing administrators to set thermal thresholds on specific devices; notifications will be generated when a threshold is crossed. [This commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/445936f9e258) gives an overview of the functionality, but the actual (netlink-based) API is uncompromisingly undocumented.

#### Security-related

- The SELinux security module can now manage policies for individual netlink operations; see [this commit message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d1d991efaf34) for a terse overview.
- The /sys/fs/selinux/user configuration knob [has been deprecated](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d7b6918e22c7) and will be removed in a future release.

#### Internal kernel changes

- There are now Rust abstractions for a number of VFS data structures and interfaces — enough to support the [Rust implementation of binder](https://lwn.net/Articles/953116/).
- The bulk of the [file-descriptor memory-safety work](https://lwn.net/Articles/985853/) has been merged.
- The kernel's cryptographic subsystem has gained a new internal API for signature generation. There is [some kerneldoc documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/next/crypto/api-sig.html#asymmetric-signature-api) available.
- There is a new variant of the sleepable RCU ("SRCU") API that makes the read side cheaper at the cost of more expensive write operations. Documentation for the new functions — srcu_read_lock_lite() and srcu_read_unlock_lite() — can be found by reading through [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/6364dd8191d2).
- The [debugobjects subsystem](https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/debug-objects.html) has been massively reworked for better performance and robustness; see [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/fb1dd1403c7b) for details.
- The venerable dontdiff file [has been removed](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b27f9e8079bf) from the documentation tree.

The 6.13 merge window can be expected to remain open through December 1. That closing date is immediately after a significant holiday weekend in the US, but past experience suggests that the 6.13-rc1 release will come out on schedule regardless. LWN will have an update of the remaining changes from this merge window once it closes.

The 6.13 merge window closed with the release of [6.13-rc1](https://lwn.net/Articles/1000378/) on December 1. By that time, 11,307 non-merge commits had been pulled into the mainline repository; about 9,500 of those landed after [our first-half merge-window summary](https://lwn.net/Articles/998623/) was written. There was a lot of new material in these patches, including architecture-support improvements, new BPF features, an efficient way to add guard pages to an address space, more Rust support, a vast number of new device drivers, and more.

The most interesting changes merged during the latter half of the 6.13 merge window include:

#### Architecture-specific

- Support for PowerPC "Maple" platforms has been removed. According to [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/62f8f307c80e): "Sadly all those machines have passed into memory, and there's been no evidence for years that anyone is still using any of them".
- The Loongarch architecture has gained support for realtime preemption and lazy preemption.
- The kernel now supports the "Smmpm", "Smnpm", and "Ssnpm" RISC-V pointer-masking extensions; [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/09d6775f503b) contains some documentation.

#### Core kernel

- There is a new kmem_cache iterator that enables BPF programs to obtain information about the state of the slab allocator. There is no documentation, but [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/1477d31b1c9a) gives an overview, and [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a496d0cdc84d) contains a test program using this feature.
- The new bpf_send_signal_task() kfunc allows a BPF program to send a signal to another process.
- There is a new BPF map feature that allows threads to share some memory with a BPF scheduler (implemented with [sched_ext](https://lwn.net/Articles/991205/)). The idea is to share hints about the workload that will let the scheduler do a better job. The feature is undocumented; see [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/c6fb8030b4ba) for an overview, and [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4579b4a4279e) for a test program.
- BPF programs can now have a private stack, reducing the risk of overflows in long call chains. [This merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/c1bc51f85cd6) contains an overview of the feature and its motivation. Only x86-64 systems support this feature for now.
- Support has been added to allow system-call entry and exit tracepoints to incur page faults in order to read user-space parameters.
- There is a new [madvise()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html) operation, MADV_GUARD_INSTALL, that installs "guard" pages in the indicated address range; an attempt to access a guard page will result in a SIGSEGV signal. These guard pages are a more efficient way to prevent code from running off the end of an allocation than PROT_NONE mappings (the only current way to do that) because it does not require the allocation of a new virtual memory area. MADV_GUARD_REMOVE will remove existing guard pages. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/662df3e5c376) for a bit more information.
- The new transparent_hugepage_shmem= command-line parameter controls the policy for the allocation of transparent huge pages in the shmem/tmpfs filesystems; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/949042811117) for some more information.

#### Filesystems and block I/O

- The EROFS filesystem has gained support for the SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA [lseek()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html) options.
- As [expected](https://lwn.net/Articles/995116/), the reiserfs filesystem has been removed from the kernel.
- The F2FS filesystem has a new feature, called "device aliasing", that allows a portion of a block device to be set aside. "Essentially, this mechanism allows a portion of the f2fs area to be temporarily reserved and used by another filesystem or for different purposes. Once that external usage is complete, the device aliasing file can be deleted, releasing the reserved space back to F2FS for its own use." See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/128d333f0dff) for a documentation update.

#### Miscellaneous

- [Trace events in Rust code](https://lwn.net/Articles/992455/) are now supported.
- Rust bindings for misc devices have been added, opening the door to the merging of a number of drivers in future development cycles.
- See [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b50ecc5aca4d) for a summary of new features added to the perf tool.
- The build system has gained support for [optimization with AutoFDO and Propeller](https://lwn.net/Articles/995397/).

#### Networking

- Networking performance in many cases is constrained by contention on the RTNL lock — a problem that has been understood for years. The 6.13 kernel contains work turning the RTNL lock into a per-network-namespace lock as a way of reducing that contention in namespace-heavy workloads (running containers, for example). It is just one step in a long process, and the regression potential is considered to be significant, so the per-namespace behavior is disabled by default. The DEBUG_NET_SMALL_RTNL configuration variable can be used to turn it on.
- There is a new, more flexible API for the control of traffic shaping; [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/bdb5d2481a53) gives an overview of how it works.
- There is a new netlink API for the control of NAPI (polling) behavior in network drivers; [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/5bedbfc16552) provides an overview.
- The long-obsolete wireless extensions emulation within the kernel will no longer export a set of symbols to loadable modules. No in-tree drivers need that feature at this point; it is possible that out-of-tree drivers might break.
- There is a new mechanism allowing network drivers to suspend interrupts during busy-traffic periods; see [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/80b6f094756f) for more information.

#### Virtualization and containers

- The [IOMMUFD subsystem](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/iommufd.html) has gained a number of new operations aimed at better support for virtual machines; see [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/341d041daae5) for an overview.
- The sound subsystem has a new pass-through mode for audio-related accelerators; [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/04177158cf98) includes an overview document.
- The new virtual CPU-frequency driver allows CPU-frequency coordination between hosts and guests; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4fd06a5358e0) for a little more information.

#### Internal kernel changes

- There is a new memory allocator for Rust code that removes the dependency on the external Alloc module. Internal documentation for the associated Allocator trait can be found in [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b7a084ba4fbb). There are also kernel-specific implementations of Box and Vec that use this allocator; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/c8cfa8d0c0b1) for some internal Box documentation and [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/2aac4cd7dae3) for Vec.
- There were 231 exported symbols removed in 6.13, while 443 new exports were added; there are also 11 new kfuncs. See [this page](https://lwn.net/Articles/1000371/) for the full list.

The 6.13 kernel development cycle now moves into the stabilization phase where, with luck, the bulk of the bugs that have inevitably been introduced will be fixed. The 6.13 release can be expected on January 19 or 26.
