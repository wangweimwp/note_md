As of this writing, 6,778 non-merge changesets have been pulled into the mainline kernel for the 6.12 release — over half of the work that had been staged in linux-next prior to the opening of the merge window. There has been a lot of refactoring and cleanup work this time around, but also some significant changes. Read on for a summary of the first half of the 6.12 merge window.

The most significant changes pulled to date include:

#### Architecture-specific

- The Arm "permission overlay extension" feature is now supported, making [memory protection keys](https://lwn.net/Articles/826554/) available on that architecture.
- There are now separate configuration options for each x86 Spectre mitigation technique, allowing kernels to be customized to specific processor models.
- The Loongarch, 64-bit Arm, PowerPC, and s390 architectures have all gained support for [the vDSO implementation of the getrandom() system call](https://lwn.net/Articles/983186/).

#### Core kernel

- Io_uring operations can now have absolute timeouts, along with the relative timeouts that were already supported.
- The remaining pieces of the [deadline server mechanism](https://lwn.net/Articles/934415/) have been merged. Deadline servers replace realtime throttling with a special server task running under the deadline scheduler; it ensures that normal-priority tasks get a small chance to run even if a realtime task is monopolizing the CPUs.
- Also completed in this cycle was the [EEVDF](https://lwn.net/Articles/969062/) scheduler, which replaces the completely fair scheduler and, with luck, provides better response times.
- Some of the preliminary work needed for the merging of the [extensible scheduling class](https://lwn.net/Articles/974387/) (sched_ext) has landed. The [pull request](https://lwn.net/ml/all/ZuOULxlZmbvY1skN@slm.duckdns.org) for sched_ext itself has also been sent, but has not been acted upon as of this writing; it seems likely to be pulled before the merge window closes.
- A [simple series](https://git.kernel.org/linus/baeb9a7d8b60) allowing realtime preemption to be configured in mainline kernels has been merged. This change [marks a milestone](https://lwn.net/Articles/990985/) in a 20-year development effort to bring realtime response to a general-purpose kernel.

#### Filesystems and block I/O

- There is a new [fcntl()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html) operation (F_CREATED_QUERY) that allows an application to determine whether a file opened with O_CREAT was actually created (rather than already existing).
- The [name_to_handle_at()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/name_to_handle_at.2.html) system call has gained the ability to provide unique, 64-bit mount IDs, eliminating a racy workaround needed until now; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4356d575ef0f) for some more information.
- The size of struct file within the kernel has been reduced from 232 bytes to 184; that will provide significant memory savings on systems running file-heavy workloads. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/3352633ce6b2) for a description of how that reduction was accomplished.
- It is no longer possible to mount a filesystem on top of any of the ephemeral files in /proc — the files under /proc/*PID*/fd, for example. Allowing such mounts makes little sense and can be a security problem, so it was removed as a bug; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d80b065bb172) for more information.
- The namespace filesystem (nsfs) has gained the ability to provide more information about mount namespaces; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/9020d0d844ad) for details.
- The EROFS filesystem can now mount filesystems directly from images stored in files; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/fb176750266a) for more details.
- The XFS filesystem has gained two ioctl() commands that will exchange the contents of two files. XFS_IOC_START_COMMIT sets up the exchange, while XFS_IOC_COMMIT_RANGE actually effects the exchange, but only if the second file has not changed in the meantime. [This commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/41c38bf024ab) contains a man page for these operations.

#### Hardware support

- **GPIO and pin control**: Analog Devices ADP5585 GPIO controllers.
- **Input**: Goodix GT7986U SPI HID touchscreens.
- **Miscellaneous**: Rockchip true random number generators, Arm NI-700 performance-monitoring units, Mobileye EyeQ reset controllers, Nuvoton MA35D1 SDHCI controllers, Analog Devices ADP5585 pulse-width modulators, and Microsoft Surface thermal sensors.
- **Networking**: AMCC QT2025 PHYs (implemented in Rust), Rockchip CAN-FD controllers, Realtek Automotive Switch 9054/9068/9072/9075/9068/9071 PCIe Interfaces, OPEN Alliance TC6 10BASE-T1x MAC-PHYs, and Microchip LAN8650/1 Rev.B0/B1 MACPHY Ethernet chips.
- **Sound**: MediaTek MT6357 codecs.

#### Networking

- The [device memory TCP patch set](https://lwn.net/Articles/979549/) has been merged. It provides an optimized data-transfer path for applications that are transferring data between the network and a peripheral device without the need to go through the CPU.

#### Security-related

- The [FOLL_FORCE removal patch](https://lwn.net/Articles/983169/) has been merged. This internal kernel flag had been used by /proc/*PID*/mem, making it an attractive target for attackers. Its removal can break some systems, so it is not effective by default; the proc_mem.force_override= command-line parameter can be used to change it. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/41e8149c8892) for a bit more information.
- The security-module subsystem now [uses static calls](https://lwn.net/Articles/979683/) for almost all callbacks, improving both performance and security.
- The Integrity Policy Enforcement security module has been added. According to [the merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a430d95c5efa): "the basic motivation behind IPE is to provide a mechanism such that administrators can restrict execution to only those binaries which come from integrity protected storage". See [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/ac6731870ed9) for more information.

#### Virtualization and containers

- 64-Bit Arm kernels can now run as a guest on [protected KVM](https://lwn.net/Articles/836693/) systems.

#### Internal kernel changes

- msleep() has long added an extra jiffy (scheduler clock tick) to the requested sleep time to ensure that the caller did not wake too soon. That padding has not been necessary to meet that requirement for some time, so it has been removed in 6.12.
- The final set of [printk() improvements](https://lwn.net/Articles/951337/) has been merged. This was the last significant piece of the realtime preemption patch set that remained out of tree.
- The interface to kmem_cache_create() has changed significantly. It now accepts a pointer to a kmem_cache_args structure describing how the cache should be created; at this time, that structure can be best seen in [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4b7ff9ab98af). Thanks to some macro magic, calls to the older API still work as expected, but those calls can be expected to be migrated to the new API over time.

The 6.12 merge window will likely remain open through September 29. Once it closes, LWN will be back with a summary of the rest of the changes merged for the next major kernel release.

Linus Torvalds [released 6.12-rc1](https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAHk-=wiwVOCZsC6a4dLdb1UjL2fS_CnLNjrPL0XGFbDd9C26Cg@mail.gmail.com/) and closed the 6.12 merge window on September 29; at that point, 11,260 non-merge change sets had been pulled into the mainline for the 6.12 release. That is the lowest number of merge-window changes since 5.17-rc1 in January 2022, which brought in 11,068 changesets. Nonetheless, 6.12 brings a number of interesting changes, many of which were included in the roughly 4,500 changes merged since [the summary of the first half of the 6.12 merge window](https://lwn.net/Articles/990750/) was written.

Significant changes entering the kernel in the second half of the merge window include:

#### Core kernel

- Several features of the version-1 control-group interface, including TCP accounting, the v1 soft limits, out-of-memory control, and pressure level, have been deprecated. As was [discussed](https://lwn.net/Articles/974575/) earlier this year, the first step is to emit warnings to see how many users (if any) are affected at this point.
- After a year of [controversy](https://lwn.net/Articles/972710/), the [extensible scheduler class](https://lwn.net/Articles/922405/) has been merged. This feature allows the writing of CPU schedulers as a set of BPF programs; it has already [resulted](https://lwn.net/Articles/991205/) in a number of interesting, specialized schedulers being written. [This commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/fa48e8d2c7b5) contains some introductory documentation.
- It is now possible to set up the tracing ring buffer in a way that allows it to persist across a reboot, perhaps saving information that would otherwise be lost in a crash. See [this changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/af9c191ac2a0) for some details.

#### Filesystems and block I/O

- The virtual filesystem layer has gained the ability to work with storage devices that have a block size larger than the system's page size. Getting to this point has required a multi-year effort, the last stages of which were [discussed](https://lwn.net/Articles/974219/) at the Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit earlier this year. At this point, only the XFS filesystem is able to take advantage of this capability.
- The filesystems in user space (FUSE) subsystem had gained support for [ID-mapped mounts](https://lwn.net/Articles/896255/).
- The NFS filesystem now supports the "LOCALIO" protocol, which allows the client and server to determine whether they are running on the same host; there are some significant performance improvements that can be had in that case. See [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/92945bd81ca4) and [this one](https://git.kernel.org/linus/f7128262b152) for more information.

#### Hardware support

- **Clock**: Rockchip RK3576 clock controllers, Qualcomm SM8150 camera clock controllers, Qualcomm SM4450 display clock controllers, Qualcomm SM4450 camera clock controllers, Qualcomm SM4450 graphics clock controllers, and DFRobot SD2405AL I2C realtime clocks.
- **GPIO and pin control**: Mobileye EyeQ5 pin controllers and Sophgo CV1800B, CV1812H, SG2000, and SG2002 SoC pin controllers.
- **Industrial I/O**: TYHX HX9023S SAR sensors, Analog Devices ADXL380 3-axis accelerometers, Analog Devices LTC2664 and LTC2672 digital-to-analog converters, Analog Devices AD4695 and AD4000 analog-to-digital converters, ROHM BH1745 color sensors, Microchip Technology PAC1921 power/current monitors, Sensirion SDP500 differential pressure sensors, ScioSense ENS210 temperature and humidity sensors, Sophgo CV1800B analog-to-digital converters, and Awinic AW96103/AW96105 proximity sensors.
- **Input**: PixArt PS/2 touchpads.
- **Media**: Extron DA HD 4K Plus CEC HDMI distribution amplifiers.
- **Miscellaneous**: native PCIe enclosure LEDs, Renesas RZ/V2H(P) watchdog timers, Nuvoton MA35 USB2.0 PHYs, AMD Queue-based DMA engines, Loongson1 APB DMA controllers, NXP LPC32xx DMA multiplexers, BlinkM I2C RGB LED controllers, Theobroma Systems Mule I2C device multiplexers, KEBA I2C controllers, TI K3 M4 remote processors, Qualcomm MSM8976 and MSM8937 interconnects, and ON Semiconductor LC824206XA microUSB switches.

#### Miscellaneous

- The user-space perf tool has gained a number of new features; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/891e8abed532) for a summary.
- Rust code now works with a number of kernel development and security features, including the KASAN sanitizer, Spectre mitigations, and kernel control-flow integrity. Most GCC plugins can now be used with Rust as well, with the only exception being [structure-layout randomization](https://lwn.net/Articles/722293/).
- There are new Rust modules for doubly linked lists and red-black trees.

#### Security-related

- The Landlock security module now supports the concept of "scoping" for Unix-domain sockets, allowing the administrator to limit communications between sandboxes. [This documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/dba40c770038) has more information. The scoping concept also applies to signals; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/1ca980815e1f) for (a little) more information.
- The Tomoyo security module can now be built as a loadable kernel module. This is a bit of a surprising change, since making security modules loadable has been resisted by the relevant maintainers for years. The [main commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/8b985bbfabbe) also includes a novel mechanism for bypassing the normal restrictions on access to (some) non-exported symbols by loadable modules. [**Update**: this change was subsequently reverted.]

#### Internal kernel changes

- The new xdrgen tool exists for "translating XDR specifications into XDR encoder and decoder functions written in the Linux kernel's C coding style". See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4b132aacb076) for more information.
- Torvalds added [a new mechanism for user-space address masking](https://git.kernel.org/linus/2865baf54077) that is intended to regain some of the performance that was lost to Spectre mitigations. It only works on x86 systems for now; it works through the application of a data-dependent mask that prevents speculation, eliminating the need to use more expensive barriers.

The 6.12 release is feature-complete at this point; all that remains is to find and fix all of the bugs that were inevitably added as well. That work will be carried out through the upcoming series of -rc releases, culminating in the 6.12 release in the second half of November.
